# Kevarly-Bio-Readme

Hey my name is kevarly Diby I  am aspiring cybersecurity enthusaist with a strong interest in red teaming and ethical hacking. Im currently part of the kkcf coding fellowship, where im really starting to learn a bit of coding skills and learning how to think like a problem solver.But my goals is for me to break into the cybersecurity field, more so on the offensive side like penetration testing and ctfs and also learning how to spot vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.
